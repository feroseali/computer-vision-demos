# Vehicle Tracker using YOLO 11

This project demonstrates real-time vehicle detection and tracking using pretrained model
Ultralytics YOLO with the BoT-SORT algorithm.

## Features
- Object detection with YOLO
- Multi-object tracking using BoT-SORT
- Video input support
- OpenCV visualization

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Insert .mp4 file in the assets folder and replace the existing .mp4 file name from the video_path variable in the code
- I used this video file https://youtu.be/wqctLW0Hb_0
